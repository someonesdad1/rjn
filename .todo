TODO
    - build.py
        - Remove /plib dependencies

- Architecture
    - git repository for the PDF files
    - Set of directories containing the PDF file
    - Only content at top is README.md and tools
    - External populating tool for each PDF directory:
        - The PDF files are copied into the repository by an external tool
        - Each directory gets an index.txt file that is used to
            describe the directory's contents
        - index.txt format
            - Non-indented line = name of PDF file
            - Indented lines below this = description of file
            - Gets turned into index.html for that directory
- Python script build.py builds the HTML interface for users each times
  it's run
    - index.html in the main repository directory
    - One index.html file in each subdirectory containing PDF files (these
      directories need to be manually entered into the build.py script)
