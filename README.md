RJN's documents
===============

Prototypical github repository for RJN's documents.  This is the top-level
README.md file for the project.  The '.md' means it's github markdown to 
produce the top-level documentation file for the repository.

Click [here](./index.html) to see a set of HTML pages that let users see
the PDF documents' links, organized by topics.

The `build.py` python script builds the necessary HTML files for the web
interface.

Each directory of PDF files must have an index.txt file containing the 
PDF file's name on a line beginning with "Â¶" (the pilcrow symbol).  The
following lines are that PDF file's description lines.
