Prototypical github repository for RJN's documents

Richard:  This is a private github repository that is currently only
visible to you and myself.

To use this repository, you'll need to put a git client on your system
and create a copy to the repository.  I will need to figure out how to add
your user name to the people allowed to modify this repository.

I envision this repository as a collection of your PDF files.  Even with
just that, it will be large because your PDFs include lots of pictures,
which use up a lot of space.  If I were you, I would create another github
repository to store all my source documents and bitmaps.  Then, when I
created new content, the PDFs would be updated and an automated tool would
copy the updated PDFs to this PDF repository.  You'd check the new files in
and users would be able to see all the versions of the PDFs you've created
with no version naming in the file, which is an error-prone way of keeping
track of things.

It remains to be seen whether github will continue to allow a person to
create free repositories like this that can consume 100 MB of space (that's
what your files currently use on my computer).  In other words, for large
enough storage requirements, they may charge a fee for storage.  The page
https://github.com/pricing shows on 30 Sep 2023 that a public repository
can use up to 500 MB of space -- and that may be enough.  You could get 2
GB for $50/year.
