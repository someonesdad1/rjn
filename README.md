Prototypical github repository for RJN's documents

Richard:  This is a private github repository that is currently only
visible to you and myself.

To use this repository, you'll need to put a git client on your system
and create a copy to the repository.  I will need to figure out how to add
your user name to the people allowed to modify this repository.

I envision this repository as a collection of your PDF files.  Even with
just that, it will be large because your PDFs include lots of pictures,
which use up a lot of space.  If I were you, I would create another github
repository to store all my source documents and bitmaps.  Then, when I
created new content, the PDFs would be updated and an automated tool would
copy the updated PDFs to this PDF repository.  You'd check the new files in
and users would be able to see all the versions of the PDFs you've created.

github allows free projects to keep up to 500 MB of stuff.  If your stuff
needs more space, $50/year gits 2 GB of space.

My guess is that you won't want to put all your source code stuff in the
online git repository -- only the resultant PDF files (or bitmaps, etc.)
need to be put there.  Then 500 MB likely would be enough to store all your
PDF stuff for public consumption.  You'd maintain the source code files on
your computer in a big git repository, but it wouldn't need to be backed up
in the cloud.
